# BetterEGaps
This a Pocketmine-5 plugin where you can modify the resistance level and remove absorption hearts after a set time or instantly

# Why would I need to do that
Well pocktetmine has a glitch with absorption hearts, when a player has absorption hearts and is hit their 
health will accurately show resulting in some anger and frustration from the player. Removing the Absorption hearts after a player gaps will fix this issue.
For resistance, mojang recently changed enchanted gapples to be like the ones we know on Java aka Resistance 2 egaps. This causes and sort of non vanilla damage
to kill the player even on gap! With this plugin you can change the resistance you get from a gap and how long you get it.

# In short terms...
Basically it removes absorption hearts from gaps due to absorption hearts causing a bug on pocketmine
And you can set the resistance level and time you get from a gap due to minecraft making you get resistance 2 now.
